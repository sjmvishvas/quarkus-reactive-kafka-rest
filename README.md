# Quarkus Reactive REST API Example

This project demonstrates a Java REST API using Quarkus with reactive programming features (RESTEasy Reactive).

## How to Build

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## How to Run

```sh
mvn quarkus:dev
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/hello

## Features

- Reactive REST endpoints using RESTEasy Reactive
- Example endpoint: `/hello`

## Requirements

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.8+

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-reactive-rest-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
